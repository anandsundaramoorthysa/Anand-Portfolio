In fact, my entire journey as a developer feels like one big, unplanned detour — an “accident” that turned into a passion. To be frank, I am not a wonderful developer. But I am also not bad at that. Actually, I spend my free time exploring different types of development like Flutter, Streamlit, Flask & More. But the flutter journey is different & crucial for me."},{type:"paragraph",value:"Like most students at the end of their undergraduate journey, I was required to secure an internship, a common expectation in colleges. While I had a foundation in development, I didn’t have any direct connections within the IT industry. Due to certain circumstances, I studying at a Tier 3 college in a rural area, despite performing well in my 12th-grade exams. So, I struggled to connect with others. To gain experience, I decided to look for internships online. However, what I found wasn’t exactly an internship — it was a paid skill development course in my point of view. The program consisted of one month of training followed by a month of project work. Even though it wasn’t an internship, I had to pay for the opportunity and I accepted it. Despite not being a traditional internship, the training provided valuable knowledge in Flutter. I learned a lot about flutter during the training days. I try out many small projects. Even though I practiced a lot, I struggled to develop the main project. According to the company, in the period of developing the app we need to develop the Mini Project as alone and the Major Project as a team."},{type:"image",src:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176333249?s=280&v=4",alt:"Namma Flutter I Flutter Chennai I LinkedIn"},{type:"paragraph",value:"My fellow team members and I had foundational knowledge, just like me.

Justin Bro introduced me to Namma Flutter, and I asked for help with an issue I was facing. Both Justin Bro and Vijay Bro kindly assisted me by explaining the problem. While it seemed like a simple explanation, I spent nearly five days trying to resolve the issue on my own but couldn’t make progress."},{type:"paragraph",value:"However, it was on that day that I managed to resolve the issue, thanks to the support of the community.

I did not get a good internship opportunity. Because I had not done the Internship in my domain. However, I got a true Internship as a Tech Research Intern and Machine Learning Intern. Side by side I learned more and more as possible like React, JSP, Servlet, JDBC, Spring, Spring Boot, and more to become a good Web Developer."},{type:"paragraph",value:"When compared to my knowledge of 2022, I am good.
