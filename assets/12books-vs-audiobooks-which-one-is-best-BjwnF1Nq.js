With the rise of audiobooks, podcasts, and AI-powered tools like NotebookLM by Google, there are numerous ways to gain knowledge. But the big question remains: which one is best?

Reading physical books might seem outdated, but to be honest, it is a solid learning method that I personally prefer."},{type:"heading",level:2,value:"Why Do I Prefer Books?"},{type:"paragraph",value:"I’ve listened to over 20+ audiobooks on finance, and I gained valuable insights on money management — how to spend, save, and invest wisely. However, whenever I try to explain these concepts to others, I sometimes struggle to recall the specific terminology. This is one drawback of audiobooks: they help in understanding ideas, but the retention of precise terms can be weaker in our minds."},{type:"paragraph",value:"On the other hand, I still remember the books which I read like Gandhiji’s Sathiya Sothanai, Nelson Mandela’s biography, and various poetry collections, my memory of them is significantly stronger compared to audiobooks. The depth of knowledge retained from reading a physical book feels more structured and lasting."},{type:"paragraph",value:"I have listened to audiobooks multiple times, often uploaded by different channels. Sometimes, they appear in the form of book summaries lasting 10 to 20 minutes. While these formats are useful. But, they don’t always provide the same deep connection and retention as reading a physical book."},{type:"heading",level:2,value:"The Power of Books"},{type:"paragraph",value:"One book that completely transformed my perspective on finance is “Rich Dad, Poor Dad.” I first listened to the audiobook twice, and it truly reshaped my understanding of money, especially the idea that “the rich don’t work for money, money works for the rich.” That concept stayed with me."},{type:"paragraph",value:"Because of the impact, I decided to buy the physical copy of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Due to time constraints, I couldn’t complete the entire book, but the first three chapters stayed deeply embedded in my mind. This is the strength of books: they leave a lasting imprint that enhances understanding and retention."},{type:"heading",level:2,value:"Audiobooks vs. Books: A Balanced View"},{type:"paragraph",value:"I’m not saying audiobooks are bad. They are great tools for learning, and they played a major role in shaping my financial knowledge. Podcasts, too, helped expand my perspective on startups and entrepreneurship. However, when compared to books, audiobooks have a slight disadvantage when it comes to deep retention and understanding."},{type:"heading",level:2,value:"Final Thoughts"},{type:"paragraph",value:"This is purely my personal opinion on the debate between books and audiobooks. Both have their advantages, and choosing the best one depends on your learning style. Even I preferred audiobooks mostly due to time constraints.
