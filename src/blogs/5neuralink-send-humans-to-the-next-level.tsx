    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Hi guys, Today‚Äôs topic feels like something straight out of a science fiction movie. But it has become a reality through the Elon Musk company ‚ÄúNeuralink‚Äù. Elon Musk is a person who thinks always differently. The different man thinks differently and achieves in different ways. Such one achievement is ‚ÄúNeuralink‚Äù the Brain Computer Interface alias ‚ÄúBCI‚Äù.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Neuralink is a neurotechnology company co-founded by Elon Musk in 2016. Guys, it‚Äôs neurotechnology not nanotechnology founded and used by Iron Man alias Tony Stark. Ok, jokes apart. The primary goal of the company is to create a direct communication pathway between the human brain and the computer to enhance human capabilities. As simply, Neuralink is a small, advanced chip designed to be implanted in the cerebrum of the human brain to give a pathway between the human brain and the computer via Bluetooth.' },

    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'The humans made mistakes. But the mistake happened here it caused danger to the patient\'s life. So, for this, the company should specially develop and manufacture the machine called as R1 Robot. They hand over the overall operation as good. It is programmed perfectly for this surgery.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'For more details about the Implantation of the Chip in the Brain Watch the below video üëá' },

    { type: 'heading', level: 2, value: 'How it works?' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'In the chip, there is an ultra-thin, flexible thread. There are 1024 threads and more in it to detect electrical signals generated by neurons. Here we all are doubting right ‚ÄúWhy need to detect electrical signals generated by neurons?‚Äù Because neurons only transmit the data all over the human body. Like the Electrical Wire passing the current. When our brain says to walk the neurons transmit the data to the leg and it happens.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Did you know about AI in Neural Networks? It‚Äôs actually created with the inspiration of humans.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Then the electrical signals are sent to a chip. The chip processes the signals and converts them into digital data wirelessly transmitted to external devices via Bluetooth. This allows for bidirectional communication, where the brain can send signals to devices and receive input in return. The system uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to decode the neural data.' },
    { type: 'heading', level: 2, value: 'What is the use case?' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'There is an enormous use case for the neuralink. In the world, not everyone is born with perfect vision, speech, or physical abilities. Many individuals face challenges from birth, such as blindness, deafness, and paralysis. Even for some of them, it happened due to some accidents. Come on guys, try to feel that. How the pain it is? In just imagine, it is like hell, right? Because today we are not just ready to live without mobile phones. In this world, how does that feel for the people?' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'But it was corrected by the technology of neuralink. How?' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'By Neuralink, for blind people, the specialized camera acts as an Eye, for deaf people the external microphone acts as an Ear. Likewise, for all people who have problems in their body, it gives a solution for it.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Now many of them think, then how it is used for us. Just imagine guys, like in Hollywood movies the eye acts as a Camera, and when humans forget anything they recall by it. How the feels gives the secondary memory is not in the laptop or system. It‚Äôs in our brain. We save the details as per like we save the details in the various devices.' },

    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'When you read it‚Äôs like a Sci-Fi Movie. But, it becomes a reality. Nowadays many of them fear AI and Humanoids have become like ‚ÄúTERMINATOR‚Äù movies in Humanoids. But it‚Äôs actually not possible. Because the person who is working on AI should learn first about the Ethical Concerns in AI. There is a standalone section or training about it. The AI should train in this manner only. It should not be trained in this manner. So don‚Äôt worry guys back to the topic.' },
    { type: 'heading', level: 2, value: 'Cons of Neuralink?' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Now we see the dark side of neuralink. Every technology has a light and dark side, right? The best example of it is in our hands, the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù. The Internet is a good tool to learn anything in the world. But it is also a bad tool to affect people. Likewise, Neuralink has had some dark side.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'When we like to say that in a word it is ‚ÄúSafety, Privacy and Control‚Äù.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'In the end, it‚Äôs a technology, right?' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Every technology is hackable and vulnerable. Whether they hacked, after the chip integrated into your brain. We became the toy for the hackers. They do anything using us. Maybe it‚Äôs possible.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Then the next thing, it‚Äôs affects our privacy as easily.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Because the eye becomes a camera. Then they record all the things we see. It‚Äôs a thread, right? When the company is like to see any of the privacy it‚Äôs easily possible. Because the neuralink is not worked under a man. It‚Äôs worked by the whole company. So, it‚Äôs a big question mark for privacy?' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Likewise, there are some problems with it.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'I hope by the blog, I explain about Neuralink in a good manner.' },
