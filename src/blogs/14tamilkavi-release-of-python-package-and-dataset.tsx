    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Hi guys ðŸ‘‹ Today, I want to share something unexpected. To be honest, if someone had told me a month ago that I could do this, I wouldn\'t have believed them. But here we are - I\'ve finally released a Python package and dataset called <em>TamilKavi</em>. I still can\'t believe I pulled it off, but it\'s real!' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'I\'d love to share the whole story with you. Many of you already know me - I write Tamil poetry and have even published two books. However, I faced font issues when trying to release them on Amazon and Kindle. Frustrated, I reached out to my community friend, <strong>Hari</strong>, and I asked them:' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: '"Bro, I want to release my Tamil poetry book on Amazon, but I\'m stuck with font issues. Do you know anyone who can solve it?"' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: '<strong>Hari</strong> referred me to <strong>Ayyanar Bro</strong>, and to me, it\'s a surpriseâ€”he was from Madurai! What a coincidence! We spoke almost four times a week for different reasons. I had already written about him and his portfolio website, which he built using Emacs & Org, so I won\'t go into more detailsâ€”you guys might find it repetitive.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Through <strong>Ayyanar Bro</strong>, I learned about the <em>Tamil Kanchilung</em> community and <em>FreeTamilBooks</em>, where I finally found a solution to my font issue. But here\'s another twistâ€”<em>FreeTamilBooks</em> required more poetry for my book release. Since I wanted to release one book on <em>FreeTamilBooks</em> and another on Amazon, it became another headache. With my tight schedule, I barely had time to write.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'While navigating all this, I discovered <strong>TamilRulePy</strong>, a Python package with Tamil grammar rules. I was eager to learn more, and unexpectedly, I got an opportunity to contribute to it! That\'s when I met <strong>Boopalan</strong>â€”another passionate tech enthusiast like me. He helped me write code for <strong>TamilRulePy</strong> and even invited me to contribute to <em>TamilString</em>, a Python package for documentation. I accepted his invitation and started working on it.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Then, during one of our conversations, I got an idea: why not develop my own Python package? And that\'s how <strong>TamilKavi</strong> was born.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'I shared my idea with <strong>Boopalan</strong> and invited him to build it as a team because, honestly, I\'m no expert. But it wasn\'t easyâ€”we had to overcome countless challenges, especially since we were both preparing for our <strong>model exams</strong> and <strong>semester exams</strong> (he\'s an MSc student, and I\'m a BSc student). It was a tough time, but I didn\'t give up. I studied, understood, and gradually started codingâ€”not entirely on my own, of course.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Now, you might wonderâ€”why build a website? Simple: to collect data from authors. But due to financial constraints, the data collection process through the website idea transformed into a <strong>Google Form</strong>, and now it is a navigation button. It\'s another story altogether. Since I had no time, I built a basic structure using <em>Lovable.dev</em> and handed it over to my juniors, <strong>Gagan & Rohith</strong>, who took care of the website.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: '<strong>The final result? Release of the Python package & website!</strong>' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'I must especially thank <strong>Praveen Bro</strong>â€”my community brother and mentor. Without hesitation, he offered me a subdomain. For me, that\'s a huge deal, and I\'m incredibly grateful!' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: '"Okay thambi, enough of this English talkâ€”why did you release the dataset?" When you ask me likewise.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Well, there\'s a reason for that, too. I\'ve seen <strong>Selvakumar Duraipandian Bro</strong> on LinkedIn post numerous Tamil datasets on <em>Hugging Face</em>, including <strong>Thirukkural</strong>, <strong>Tholkappiyam</strong>, and more. I was truly inspired by his work. So, I released mine as a dataset.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Now, you might ask, "So, thambi, after all this talk, what does your package actually do?"' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'It\'s simpleâ€”<strong>TamilKavi helps discover new Tamil poems.</strong> That\'s all. Now your mind is' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: '<em>"Edhuka evalo seenu?"</em>' },
    { type: 'paragraph', value: 'Well, I\'m not just a developer. The person who is a Tamil poet & tech enthusiast knows how crazy this project is. Through this journey, I\'ve learned so much, especially about <strong>GitHub workflows</strong>.' },
